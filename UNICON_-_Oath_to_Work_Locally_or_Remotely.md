**Oath to Work Locally or Remotely**

I, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, solemnly affirm that humanity's future sustainability and evolution depend profoundly upon the widespread adoption of 100% telecommuting and the establishment of fully walkable cities. Recognizing the urgency to reduce our collective ecological footprint, I pledge my unwavering commitment to never accept employment requiring even one mandatory in-office day per week, unequivocally rejecting hybrid or full-time on-site work.

I firmly resolve to exclusively pursue employment opportunities that allow me to work entirely remotely or, if absolutely necessary, within a maximum radius of 2.2 miles (3.5 kilometers)—approximately a 45-minute walk—from my home. Should I ever find myself compelled by circumstance or employer demands to violate this oath, I vow to actively seek alternate remote employment or face voluntary termination of my current role.

By taking this oath, I dedicate myself to promoting telecommuting and walkable urban environments as foundational elements essential to the advancement and sustainability of human civilization.

I affirm this oath willingly and knowingly, embracing it as a fundamental condition for full membership and active participation in UNICON, The Church of Universal Consciousness.
